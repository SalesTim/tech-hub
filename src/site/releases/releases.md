## Validation rings

Our release process is comprised of multiple "rings" of validation that are related to specific environments, to a specific audience and a specific compliance labeling level:

| 💍 Ring | Environments | Primary Audience | Purpose |
|:-------:|--------------|------------------|---------|
| **4** | **production** | Customers (All) | Obvious isn't it? ;-) |
| **3.5** | **staging** | SalesTim | Test automated deployments and upgrades in an iso-production environment |
| **3** | **beta** | Customers (Preview) | Preview environment designed to help some customers prepare for updates, from a technical and change management standpoint |
| **2** | **uat** | SalesTim (Product Team) | The product team tests SalesTim to verify whether it meets their expectations |
| **1.5** | **alpha** | Partners (SI/ISV) | Give strategic partners an early look at the features we're currently working on |
| **1** | **dogfood** | SalesTim | SalesTim Internal [Dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) |
| **0** | **integration** | SalesTim (Tech Team) | Integrations and functional testing by the tech team |

Using this kind of rings has many advantages:
* Clear and common understanding of each ring purpose
* Separation of concerns
* Real isolation between environments
* Enforced security


## Versioning strategy

SalesTim versioning strategy adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).  
A version number may be comprised of 3 to 4 components and takes this form:
```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-BUILD
```

Meaning of each component:
  * MAJOR: version that includes incompatible changes (data schema, api signatures...)
  * MINOR: version that includes functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
  * PATCH: version that includes backwards-compatible bug fixes
  * BUILD: incremental development-only version
