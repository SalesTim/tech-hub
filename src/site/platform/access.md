## Network diagram
In order to prepare your organization's network for SalesTim, here is an overview of the the different network flows involved:

<img src="/img/platform/networkDiagram.png" style="width: 800px;">

This diagram is comprised of three forms of traffic.  

### Regular Microsoft Teams flows (Purple lines)

The Microsoft Teams client has two main flows, one for authentication against your Azure AD and one for Microsoft API.  
**The flows are not impacted by SalesTim.**

### SalesTim's internal flows (Orange lines)

**These flows are entirely internal to SalesTim and have no impact on your network infrastructure.**

### Flows between your organization's network and the SalesTim platform (Green lines)

**All the traffic from and to the SalesTim platform uses HTTPS protocol on port 443.**  
Here is a short description of each flow:
1. *.salestim.io for the main app, *.salestim.com for online help contents
2. *.msecnd.net and *..visualstudio.com for performance metrics analysis
3. *.windows.net for blob cache storage
4. *.microsoft.com for Microsoft Graph API access

## Traffic encryption

All the traffic from and to the SalesTim platform is SSL encrypted (and HTTPS protocol enforced), using [TLS v1.2](https://github.com/ssllabs/research/wiki/SSL-and-TLS-Deployment-Best-Practices), ensuring secure communication between our customers and our platform.

## DDoS prevention

While we've prevented rogue traffic from accessing our servers and network, itâ€™s still possible for external services to block anyone else from using our service by creating a distributed, denial-of-service attack.  
To prevent this, we're using Azure Traffic Manager as a first level of protection.  
Learn more about [Azure Traffic Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview)

## Domains whitelisting

We understand that our customers need to be confident that they are communicating with SalesTim in a secure environment. Domains whitelisting is one of the most effective methods of ensuring this and prevents any internet traffic intended for SalesTim from being hijacked or rerouted to a rogue website.  
Our complete portfolio of domains are outlined below to help our customers configure their corporate web proxy.
