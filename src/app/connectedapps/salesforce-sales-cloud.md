## Create a new Salesforce Connected App

1. Open your Salesforce `setup` page, enter 'Apps' in the Quick Find box, and select `App Manager`.
2. Click `New Connected App`.
3. Enter 'SalesTim' as a the connected app’s name
    - This name is displayed in the App Manager and on its App Launcher tile.
    - The connected app name must be unique within your org.
    - If the connected app was created in the Spring ‘14 release or later, you can reuse the name of a deleted connected app.
4. Enter 'SalesTim' as the `API name`.
    - It defaults to a version of the name without spaces.
    - Only letters, numbers, and underscores are allowed, so if the original app name contains any other characters, edit the default name.
5. Enter your own email or any other email as the `Contact Email` for Salesforce to use in case we want to contact you or your support team.
    - This address isn’t given to Salesforce admins who install the app.
6. (Optional) Enter the `Contact Phone` for Salesforce to use in case we want to contact you or your support team.
    - This number isn’t given to Salesforce admins who install the app.
7. (Optional) Paste this address as the `Logo Image Url`:
    ```
    https://developers.salestim.com/color.png
    ```
    - This  logo also displays on the consent page that users see when approving the app.
    - The logo URL must use HTTPS.
    - The logo image must be a GIF, JPG, or PNG file with a file size that’s preferably under 20 KB and no more than 100 KB. Salesforce resize the image to 128 pixels by 128 pixels, so be sure that you like how it looks. If you don’t supply a logo, Salesforce generates one for you using the app’s initials.
8. (Optional) Paste this address as the `Info Url`:
    ```
    https://developers.salestim.com
    ```
9. (Optional) Paste 'SalesTim App for Salesforce' as the `Description`.
