# 1. Require two-factor authentication

![Intercom 2FA badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/2FA-Verified-success.svg?logo=intercom)

If you select the [two-factor authentication...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) option, each time you login you will need to enter your password and provide a unique code.  

***How to set it up?***

Choose the ‘Require two-factor authentication’ option and click ‘Save’:

Download the [Microsoft Authenticator App...](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/authenticator)  
You'll be asked to scan a QR code on your screen:

![Intercom QR Code](/assets/images/IntercomQRCode.png)

When you log in the next time, you'll need to add your password and then a code generated from your authentication app on your smart phone.  

**Important**: When you set up 2FA you'll be given the option to generate recovery codes. We recommend generating recovery codes to avoid potentially being locked out of your account. You'll also need a recovery code to disable 2FA (for example, if you're switching phones).

# 2. Whitelist your domains

![Intercom verified domains badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Domains-Verified-success.svg?logo=intercom)

We created a whitelist of specific SalesTim domains that the Intercom Messenger can be seen on.  

Benefit: The Intercom Messenger will only appear on these domains (therefore it won’t appear in unintended locations).

***How to set it up?***

Just add your domains to the whitelist from your messenger settings:

# 3. Enable identity verification

![Intercom identity verification badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Identity-Verified-success.svg?logo=intercom)

Benefit: Identity Verification helps us to make sure that conversations between you and us are kept private and that one user can't impersonate another.

Identity Verification works by using a server side generated [HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) (hash based message authentication code), using [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2), implemented using the [Node Crypto API](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html).

Then, everywhere that you load user data and have a window.intercomSettings code snippet, add a new attribute called user_hash and assign the HMAC code for the logged-in user to it:

```javascript
window.intercomSettings = {
  app_id: "APP_ID",
  user_id: "USER_ID",
  user_hash: "INSERT_HMAC_VALUE_HERE"
}
```

***How to set it up?***

Just turn it on from your workspace settings and follow the instructions for your app:

# To go further

Intercom brings to the table a lot of options to enforce your security, therefore these 3 easy to implement steps are just the beginning of an epic journey.  

Here are a few other areas of investment that we're currently working on that may interest you, so stay tuned for later posts.

## a. Create a test workspace

Set up a test workspace of Intercom in your development / staging environment to be sure it’s working correctly before putting it live.  

![Intercom test workspace](/assets/images/IntercomTestWorkspace.png)

Benefits:
* Enforce isolation between your test and production environments
* Be sure it’s working correctly before putting it live

## b. GDPR
In addition to security, and even if [Intercom complies with GDPR](https://www.intercom.com/help/pricing-privacy-and-terms/data-protection/how-intercom-complies-with-gdpr), you'll have to work on an automated process to link your GDPR process with Intercom and other third-party services...
