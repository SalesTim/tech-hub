<Classification label="public" />

Build context-relevant, action-oriented Microsoft Teams apps directly on top of SalesTim with ease.  
Here at SalesTim, we know you want to concentrate on the value of your products and services, and not be challenged by the complexities of integration. Our APIs will take care of the underlying technical complexity, leaving you free to take care of your real value proposition. 

::: tip
The easiest way to start exploring services available through the SalesTim API is to use our API Explorer.  
API Explorer lets you craft REST requests (with full CRUD support), adapt the HTTP request headers, and see the data responses. To help you get started, API Explorer also provides a set of sample queries. Experiment with new APIs before you integrate them into your application.
