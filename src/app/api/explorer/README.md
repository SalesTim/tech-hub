# API Explorer

API Explorer lets you craft REST requests (with full CRUD support), adapt the HTTP request headers, and see the data responses. To help you get started, API Explorer also provides a set of sample queries. Experiment with new APIs before you integrate them into your application.

:::tip
API sets on the v1.0 endpoint (https://api.salestim.io/v1.0) are in general availability (GA) status, and are ready for production use. Updates to APIs on this endpoint are additive in nature and should not break existing app scenarios.
