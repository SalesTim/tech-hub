**ABSTRACT**  
The SalesTim API SDKs are designed to simplify building high-quality, efficient, and resilient applications that access the SalesTim API.  
The service library contains models and request builders that are generated from the SalesTim API metadata to provide a rich, strongly typed, and discoverable experience when working with the many datasets available in the SalesTim API.
