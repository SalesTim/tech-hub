# Versions

The SalesTim API currently supports two versions: `v1.0` and `beta`.

## API v1.0 <Badge text="v1.0"/>
SalesTim API under the `v1.0` endpoint (under `https://api.salestim.io/v1.0`) are in general availability (`GA`) status.    
Note: Updates to APIs on this endpoint are additive in nature and should not break existing app scenarios.

:::tip Recommendation
**Use v1.0 APIs for your production apps**.
:::

## API Beta <Badge text="beta" type="warning"/>
SalesTim API under the `beta` endpoint (under `https://api.salestim.io/beta`) includes APIs that are currently in preview. Because we might introduce breaking changes to our beta APIs, we recommend that you use the beta version only to test apps that are in development.

:::warning Recommendation
**Do NOT use beta APIs in your production apps**.
