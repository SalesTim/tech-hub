On Friday, June 29, AvePoint passed the International Organizations for Standardization’s (ISO) information security management system (ISMS) audit using the 27001:2013 framework!

ISO is an independent, non-governmental international organization with a membership of 161 national standard bodies. ISO is credited for publishing more than 2,100 international standards covering almost every industry from technology to food safety.



Our ISO certification for AvePoint, Inc. covers the management, operation and maintenance of the people and information assets, information systems and the associated processes that enable corporate operations as well as the development and deployment of products and services provided to customers and employees of AvePoint, Inc.

AvePoint builds on the foundation and discipline necessary to develop and support some of the leading privacy and security products in the world.  As part of our Privacy and Security Program we have implemented a governance structure through which we:

Engage senior management on data privacy and security issues
Align policies, procedures and technical controls to demonstrate our process and our commitment to our customers and users
Train each of our employees on all privacy and security expectations.

Furthermore, we have extended embedded privacy and security by design into our product life cycle processes. We have also implemented a program to manage third-party risk.

The implementation of such compliance-driven programs is not new to AvePoint, and we remain fully committed to approaching this initiative diligently with the utmost focus on securing and maintaining customer trust.

This certification illustrates the maturity and robustness of our on-premise software solutions and our SaaS-based AOS platform as we help 6 million Office 365 users manage and protect their Office 365 data across Exchange, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, Teams, Groups, Yammer, Skype For Business.

ISO certification is undoubtedly a huge milestone for the company. At the same time, it also represents a steadfast commitment to continually improving our information security and privacy programs. This is a great opportunity for AvePoint to say what we do, do what we say, and prove it.

We believe that security must be everyone’s job. If you treat it as an afterthought or leave it to the people in IT (or even to your CISO) then you’ve already failed. No matter how great the security team is that your organization employees, history has shown us that the adversaries are too much and too many. While we as security practitioners need to get our defenses right every time, hackers only need to be right once. So, with that being said, make security the job of every one of your employees and you’ll have an army to protect your data.

What does that mean practically and operationally? Clearly not everyone in your company is going to be a data protection or security expert, nor is that necessary. The reality is that all of your employees should understand that no one will care about the privacy of their data more than they do–and no one should work harder to protect it than they should.

This is true not only for their own personal information, but also for the data (customer information, corporate secrets, etc.) that they use every day as part of their job. Security is everyone’s job and should be as fundamental a part of your employment agreement as anything else that you do.
