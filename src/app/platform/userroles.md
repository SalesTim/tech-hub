# Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

<Classification label="public" />

Role based access control (RBAC) enables Microsoft 365 global administrators to define permissions and restrict access to specific SalesTim's features to specific groups of users.

To implement RBAC and provide a high level of granularity, SalesTim relies on both standard Microsoft 365 roles, namely `Teams service admin` and `Global admin`, and also on some application specific roles, such as `Catalog managers` and `Integration manager`.

## Roles and Profiles
Here is the matrix of features/roles supported by the SalesTim platform:
