As a Microsoft Teams App, SalesTim relies on several "first-party" components and services such as the Microsoft Teams platform and Microsoft Azure.  
In addition the SalesTim platform uses several "second-party" or "third-party" services, especially:
- GitHub Enterprise is our source code repository platform and issue tracking tool. [Learn more...](https://github.com/)
- Intercom is our chat application for communication with our prospects and customers from our website, and users in our apps. [Learn more...](https://www.intercom.com/)
- As SalesTim is not in the business of storing or processing payments, all payments made to SalesTim goes through our partner, Stripe. [Learn more...](https://stripe.com/)

The SalesTim Platform relies entirely on the Microsoft Azure platform.  
Here is a summary of the key architecture components involved:

| Service | Role |
|---------|------|
| Azure Traffic Manager | Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that enables us to distribute traffic optimally to services across global Azure regions, while providing high availability and responsiveness. We're using it to increase application availability, improve application performance and perform service maintenance without downtime. [Learn more...](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview) |
| Azure App Service | The SalesTim Platform is hosted as a containerized app on Linux, enabling vertical and horizontal scale-up based on application needs and reach high availability. [Learn more...](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/) |
| Azure Application Insights | Application Insights is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM). We're using it to monitor our live production environments, gather telemetry such as performance counters, Azure diagnostics, Docker logs and diagnostic trace logs. [Learn more...](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-insights/app-insights-overview) |
| Azure Cache for Redis | Azure Cache for Redis is based on the popular software [Redis](https://redis.io/). It is used as a cache mechanism to improve the performance and scalability of the SalesTim Platform, especially for back-end data store access and external APIs requests. [Learn more...](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview) |
| Azure Cosmos DB | Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service that supports document, key-value, wide-column, and graph databases. The SalesTim Platform relies on it as the main back-end data store. [Learn more...](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/)
| Azure Key Vault | Microsoft Azure Key Vault is a cloud-hosted management service that allows the SalesTim Platform to encrypt keys and small secrets by using keys that are protected by hardware security modules (HSMs). The SalesTim Platform relies on it to store securely its encryption keys. [Learn more...](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/) |
| Azure Blob Storage | Azure Blob Storage is a massively scalable object storage for unstructured data that allows the SalesTim Platform to store securely blobs contents such as images. [Learn more...](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/) |

| Security Measures | Description |
|:-----------------:|-------------|
| HTTPS | All data received from and sent to GitHub is encrypted in transit. |
| Verified Domains | You can verify the domains controlled by your organization to confirm your organization's identity on GitHub. Organization owners are be able to verify the identity of organization members by viewing each member's email address within the verified domain. |
| 2FA | Access to our private repository requires two-factor authentication for everyone in the SalesTim organization. [Learn more...](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/) |
| Protected Branches | Protected branches ensure that collaborators on our repositories cannot make irrevocable changes to branches. Enabling protected branches also allows us to enable other optional checks and requirements, like required status and security checks and required reviews. Moreover, deployment to production environments requires at leats two human validation steps. [Learn more...](https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/) |
| Security Alerts | GitHub automatically tracks public vulnerabilities in packages from supported languages on MITRE's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) List, and use a combination of machine learning and human review to detect vulnerabilities that are not published in the CVE list. |
