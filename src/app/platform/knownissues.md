## Provisionning is stopped after enabling MFA

### Behavior / Symptom / Root Cause
If you enforce MFA for the service account AFTER it has been configured in SalesTim, the provisionning process stops to work.

**Root Cause**: Enabling MFA for an account resets its credentials, access token and refresh token. Therefore the service account cannot refresh its own token anymore.

### Known Workaround
Update the service account from the "Settings" tab using the "Update" button.

## "Missing Teams in List All Teams" when creating a new template

### Behavior / Symptom / Root Cause
When creating a new template in your catalog, some older teams may not appear in search results and therefore cannot be used as a cloned team.

**Root Cause**: Some teams that were created in the past (The old days of Microsoft Teams...) but haven't been used recently by a Microsoft Teams user aren't listed by the "list all teams" endpoint from the Microsoft Graph API.

New teams will be correctly listed.
Certain old teams don't have a:
```json
"resourceProvisioningOptions": [
    "Team"
],
```
property that contains "Team", which is set on newly created teams and teams that are visited in Microsoft Teams.

### Known Workaround
Reopen the team with a team owner account (To be confirmed).
