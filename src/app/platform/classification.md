# Classification labels

<Classification label="public" />

To get their work done, people at SalesTim collaborate with others both inside and outside the organization. This means that content roams everywhere, and when it roams, we want it to do so in a secure, protected way that meets our organization’s business and compliance policies.  


Here is the list of classification labels we're using, from the most to the least restrictive:

| Level | Label | Emoji | Description |
|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|:------------|
| 1 | **`CONFIDENTIAL`** | 🔥 | Material that can only be accessed by some specific employees (authenticated). |
| 2 | **`INTERNAL`** | 🔐 | Material that can be accessed by any employee (authenticated). |
| 3 | **`EXTERNAL`** | 🔑 | Material that can be accessed by external non-employees users, such as customers and partners (authenticated). |
| 4 | **`PUBLIC`** | 📢 | Material that can be accessed publicly by any anonymous user (unauthenticated). |
