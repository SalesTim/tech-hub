# Data Management Practices

We understand that our customers need to be confident using SalesTim, and be aware of our data collection practices.

::: tip Note
This section is subject to change and we recommend that you check back quarterly for updates.
:::

## Application data

Through the implementation of its different features, SalesTim access, processes and stores several kind of data:
- [User profiles](#user-profiles)
- [Organization settings](#organization-settings)
- [Templates Catalog](#templates-catalog)
- [User requests](#user-requests)
- [Teams data](#teams-data)

Here is how we're managing data for these different categories:
| Data | Accessed | Cached | Stored | Notes |
|------|:--------:|:------:|:------:|-------|
| User profiles | âœ” | âœ” | âœ” | Accessed and updated after each login.<br/>Cached for 1h.<br/>Stored as long as the organization is active. |
| Organization settings | âœ” | âœ” | âœ” | Accessed and updated after each admin login.<br/>Cached for 24h.<br/>Stored as long as the organization is active. |
| Templates catalog | âœ” | ðŸš« | âœ” | Accessed by the SalesTim web client and during provisioning operations.<br/>Stored as long as the organization is active. |
| User requests | âœ” | ðŸš« | âœ” | Accessed by the SalesTim web client and during provisioning operations.<br/>Stored as long as the organization is active. |
| Teams conversations | ðŸš« | ðŸš« | ðŸš« | No access.<br/>No cache.<br/>No storage. |
| Teams files | ðŸš« | ðŸš« | ðŸš« | No access.<br/>No cache.<br/>No storage. |
| Planner tabs | âœ” | ðŸš« | ðŸš« | Accessed during cloning operations.<br/>No cache.<br/>No storage. |
| Other tabs | âœ” | ðŸš« | ðŸš« | Tabs configurations are accessed during cloning, without access to tabs contents.<br/>No cache.<br/>No storage. |

::: tip
As you can see, we're not storing (nor in cache nor in database) any team content as part of our provisioning process. Teams data are processed in memory and not persisted.
:::

### User profiles

SalesTim stores a subset of Office 365 user profiles in our caching platform, in order to target templates through our audience targeting feature.

::: warning Email address usage
Email address are used solely to identify users and apply audience targeting rules, and never to sollicit users directly for marketing purposes.
:::

Sample:
``` javascript
{
  "id": "", // SalesTim internal user ID
  "userLicense": "", // SalesTim user licence
  "msUserId": "", // Active Directory user ID
  "msTenantId": "", // Active Directory tenant ID
  "msUPN": "", // Active Directory user UPN
  "msCompanyName": "", // Company name
  "msEmail": "", // Active Directory user email
  "msDisplayName": "", // Active Directory user display name
  "msGivenName": "", // Active Directory user first name
  "msCountry": "", // Country
  "msPreferredLanguage": "", // Office 365 Preferred language
  "msDepartment": "", // Department  
  "msCity": "", // City
  "msJobTitle": "", // // Job title
  "msSurname": "", // Active Directory user last name
  "msUsageLocation": "" // Office 365 usage location
}
```

User profiles are updated during each login, and stored as long as the organization is active.

::: tip
User profiles could be deleted upon simple request.

### Teams data

As part of its provisionning feature, SalesTim may access, process or store temporarily or permanently certain metadata or data.

#### Teams conversations

SalesTim NEVER access, process or store teams conversations.

#### Teams files

SalesTim NEVER access, process or store teams files tabs contents (Files metadata, files contents, folders...), as the cloning process from a template to the provisionned team is effectively implemented through a standard Microsoft Graph operation, that doesn't require SalesTim to access files.

#### Planner tabs

SalesTim reads plans contents (Plans, buckets, tasks, categories) from the template to clone plans contents during the provisionning process.
Plans contents are only processed IN MEMORY and NEVER stored, nor in cache nor permenently in a database.

#### Other tabs

SalesTim reads tabs metadata (Tab name and configuration) from the template to clone tabs during the provisionning process, but doesn't access their contents.
Tabs metadata are only processed IN MEMORY and NEVER stored, nor in cache nor permenently in a database.

## Metadata Collection

In addition to core application data, SalesTim collects metadata to help us understand how the product is being used and what kinds of errors, such as sign-in errors, have occurred. This information helps us understand usage patterns, plan new features, and troubleshoot and fix problem areas.

Collected metadata falls into these four categories:
-  [Census data](#census-data)
-  [Usage data](#usage-data)
-  [Support data](#support-data)
-  [Error reporting data](#error-reporting-data)

## Census data
Census data is acquired solely to provide, support, and improve SalesTim. It includes environmental information such as device and operating system versions, and regional and language settings. Here are some specific examples of the census data that's collected:

| Data type | Example | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| AppName | SalesTim | |
| DeviceModel | iPhone | |
| OSName | iPhoneiOS | |
| OSVersion | 8.3 | |
| UserLanguage | EN-US | |
| UserID | E296D735-4F36-4E18-7C3B-52E1A02A0164 | SalesTim automatically generates anonymous user IDs, then populates telemetry events with these IDs as they're sent from the app. A hashing ensures the ID cannot be linked to a specific user. |
| Session ID | 5E872200-F546-4CCD-8F23-AF5F507AA2DD | SalesTim automatically generates anonymous session IDs, then populates telemetry events with these IDs as they're sent from your app. A hashing ensures the ID cannot be linked to a specific user. |

These anonymous data are collected through the Azure Application Insights service.  
For reference, see [Usage analysis with Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/usage-overview)


In addition, we're collecting anonymous network latency measurements (aka Real User Measurements) through the Azure Traffic Manager service to apply load-balancing rules more effectively.  
For reference, see [How to send Real User Measurements to Azure Traffic Manager using web pages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-create-rum-web-pages)

::: tip
Census data DOES NOT contain any information that identifies your organization or users.
:::

::: warning
Census data collection is on by default and cannot be turned off by admins or end users.
:::


## Usage data

Usage data includes information such as requests status, teams provisioning, approval status, frequency of features used, and stability issues.

Usage data contains information that identifies your organization, such as domain names, and your users. Here are some specific examples of the usage data that are collected:

```javascript
{
  request_created: {
    request_id: '5E872200-F546-4CCD-8F23-AF5F507AA2DD',
    team_name: 'TEAM_NAME',
    request_additionalMembers: '5',
    request_additionalOwners: '3',
    template_id: '5E872200-F546-4CCD-8F23-AF5F507AA2DD',
    template_name: 'TEMPLATE_NAME'
  },
  request_approved: {
    request_id: '5E872200-F546-4CCD-8F23-AF5F507AA2DD'
  },
  request_rejected: {
    request_id: '5E872200-F546-4CCD-8F23-AF5F507AA2DD'
  },
  request_processed: {
    request_id: '5E872200-F546-4CCD-8F23-AF5F507AA2DD'
  },
  request_error: {
    request_id: '5E872200-F546-4CCD-8F23-AF5F507AA2DD'
  },
  team_created: {
    team_id: '5E872200-F546-4CCD-8F23-AF5F507AA2DD',
    team_name: 'TEAM_NAME',
    template_id: '5E872200-F546-4CCD-8F23-AF5F507AA2DD',
    template_name: 'TEMPLATE_NAME'
  }
}
```      

::: warning

Usage data are processed in two ways:
* We are processing anonymous usage data to understand how our customers are using SalesTim.
* We are processing non-anonymous usage data to create in-app usage dashboards and audit trails for our customers administrators.

## Support data

Support data includes information such as user UPN, tenant ID, app version. Access to these data is restricted to our support team, and is only used in case of a direct support request to our support team.

Support data contains information that identifies your organization, such as contoso.com, and your users. Here are some specific examples of the usage data that's collected, for three distinct kinds of profiles.

  "intercomEmail": '', // User UPN
  "locale": 'EN-US', // User current language
  "msTenantId": '', // Organization tenant ID
  "msUpn": '', // User UPN
  "theme": 'Dark', // Current Teams theme
  "msUserId": '', // Active Directory user ID

## Data Residency

The SalesTim Platform relies entirely on the Microsoft Azure platform.  
Here is a summary of the key architecture components and their associated data residency:

| Service | Role | Data Location |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Azure Traffic Manager | Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that enables us to distribute traffic optimally to services across global Azure regions. | By definition, this service is located in multiple regions globally, but doesn't store any data. |
| Azure App Service | The SalesTim Platform is hosted as a containerized app on Linux containers, enabling vertical and horizontal scale-up based on application needs and reach high availability. | **France Central** |
| Azure Application Insights | Application Insights is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM). We're using it to monitor our live production environments, gather telemetry such as performance counters, Azure diagnostics, and diagnostic trace logs. | **France Central** |
| Azure Cache for Redis | Azure Cache for Redis is based on the popular software [Redis](https://redis.io/). It is used as a cache mechanism to improve the performance and scalability of the SalesTim Platform, especially for back-end data store access and external APIs requests. | **France Central** |
| Azure Cosmos DB | Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service that supports document, key-value, wide-column, and graph databases. The SalesTim Platform relies on it as the main back-end data store. | Read Locations: **France Central**.  Write Locations: **France Central** |
| Azure Key Vault | Microsoft Azure Key Vault is a cloud-hosted management service that allows the SalesTim Platform to encrypt keys and small secrets by using keys that are protected by hardware security modules (HSMs). The SalesTim Platform relies on it to store securely its encryption keys. | **France Central** |
| Azure Blob Storage | Azure Blob Storage is a massively scalable object storage for unstructured data that allows the SalesTim Platform to store securely blobs contents such as templates pictures. | **France Central** |
