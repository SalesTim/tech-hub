## Understanding your options
Team creation approval workflow in SalesTim could be configured using one of these options:
- [Approval email sent by SalesTim](#approval-email-sent-by-salestim): This is the default and easiest option, works without any configuration.
- [Approval email sent by your organization](#approval-email-sent-by-your-organization): If you need advanced security/compliance control over your notification emails.
- [Microsoft Teams Approval App](#microsoft-teams-approval-app): A Microsoft Teams native experience, that you can customize using Power Automate or Logic Apps.
- [Use your own custom app](#use-your-own-custom-app): Bring your own aproval workflow as a custom application.

## Approval email sent by SalesTim

### How does it work?
This is the option enabled by default in any new organization, and doesn't require any configuration. In this mode, the approval process is implemented as an Outlook actionable email, send from the `notifications@salestim.io` address.

SalesTim does **NOT** collect **ANYTHING** from these notification emails, neither openings, nor clicks, and does not include any invisible image or other form of tracker.

### What about security?   
Actionable messages security is guaranteed by:
- The fact that the actionable message could only be used from the context of a secured Outlook client, and that end-user authentication is entirely managed by the Outlook client (Desktop, Web and Mobile) by providing to the actionable message the required token.
- A sender verification is enforced using signed cards. See: [Sender verification
](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/security-requirements#sender-verification)
- Phishing prevention is ensured by using a [Card Signing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/security-requirements#signed-card-payloads) mechanism
- Requests sent by the actionable message are verified to ensure that they originate from Microsoft. See: [Verifying that requests come from Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/security-requirements#verifying-that-requests-come-from-microsoft)
- The token provided by Outlook to the actionable message is used to verify the end-user identity. See: [Verifying the identity of the user](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/security-requirements#verifying-the-identity-of-the-user).

As a Microsoft 365 administrator, you can directly manage an end-user mailbox rules, and add the `notifications@salestim.io` address to its "Safe Senders" list.

## Approval email sent by your organization

### How does it work?
For advanced control over your approval notification emails (for instance to implement custom Exchange transport rules), you can configure SalesTim to send your approval emails from your own internal email as a sender.
