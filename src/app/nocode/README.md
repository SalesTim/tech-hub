## What are No-Code Solutions and Teams Templates?

`No-Code Solutions` are applications built using the [SalesTim API](/api/) but without requiring a strong technical background, such as apps built on top of the [Microsoft Power Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/powerplatform/), especially [PowerApps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/powerapps-overview) and [Power Automate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/getting-started).

In addition, at the core of the SalesTim Platform, `Teams Templates` are a combination of two elements:
- A team template, describing the structure and contents of a team.
- A governance policy that may include security and compliance rules.

These templates may be:
- Created by yourself and saved in your private corporate catalog for your internal use
- Public and accessible from the Microsoft Teams [Template Store](https://store.salestim.com)

Through these teams templates, end-users can create ready-to-use and full-featured teams, customized to perform a specific business activity, such as:
- Project management
- Proposal management
- Crisis management
- Recruitment process
- Department-level collaboration

## How to create them?
This question is already largely covered in our [Help Center](https://help.salestim.com/collections/2021774-build-your-microsoft-teams-templates), especially for the most basic use cases.

But if you need more advanced capabilities, we've got you covered.
Here is a list of advanced capabilities from the SalesTim Platform that you can leverage to create more advanced templates:
- Use [Microsoft Power Platform with SalesTim API](/nocode/power-platform) to create advanced PowerApps apps and Power Automate flows.
- Create advanced [Naming Conventions](/nocode/naming-conventions) to keep your Microsoft Teams environment clean and manageable.
- Create advanced rules of [Audience Targeting](/nocode/audience-targeting) to selectively show or hide your teams templates to specific users or groups.
- Use the [SalesTim API](/api/) to automate your Microsoft Teams governance or create your own teams provisioning workflow.
