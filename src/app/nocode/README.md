## What are No-Code Solutions?
`No-Code Solutions` are applications built using the SalesTim app and its provisioning and governance engine.
At the core of the SalesTim Platform, `Teams Templates` are a combination of two elements:
- A team template, describing the structure and contents of a team.
- A governance policy that may include security and compliance rules.

Through these teams templates, end-users can create ready-to-use and full-featured teams, customized to perform a specific business activity, such as:
- Project management
- Proposal management
- Crisis management
- Recruitment process
- Department-level collaboration

## How to create them?
This question is already largely covered in our [Help Center](https://help.salestim.com/collections/2021774-build-your-microsoft-teams-templates), especially for the most basic use cases.

But if you need more advanced capabilities, we've got you covered.
Here is a list of advanced capabilities from the SalesTim Platform that you can leverage to create more advanced templates:
- Create advanced [Naming Conventions](/nocode/naming-conventions) to keep your Microsoft Teams environment clean and manageable.
- Create advanced rules of [Audience Targeting](/nocode/audience-targeting) to selectively show or hide your teams templates to specific users or groups.
- Create [Approval Workflows](/nocode/approval) to control team creation in your environment.
