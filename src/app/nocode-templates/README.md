# No-Code Templates

With the SalesTim Platform, you can automate your business process with Microsoft Teams by creating powerful teams templates without any technical skills.

## What are no-code templates?
In the SalesTim Platform, templates are a combination of two elements:
- A team template, describing the structure and contents of a team.
- A governance policy that may include security and compliance rules.

These templates may be:
- Created by yourself and saved in your private corporate catalog for your internal use
- Public and accessible from the Microsoft Teams [Template Store](https://store.salestim.com)

Through these teams templates, end-users can create ready-to-use and full-featured teams, customized to perform a specific business activity, such as:
- Project management
- Proposal management
- Crisis management
- Recruitment process
- Department-level collaboration

## How to create them?
This question is already largely covered in our [Help Center](https://help.salestim.com/collections/2021774-build-your-microsoft-teams-templates), especially for the most basic use cases.

But if you need more advanced capabilities, we've got you covered.
Here is a list of advanced capabilities from the SalesTim Platform that you can leverage to create more advanced templates:
- Create advanced [Naming Conventions](/nocode-templates/naming-conventions) to keep your Microsoft Teams environment clean and manageable.
- Create advanced rules of [Audience Targeting](/nocode-templates/audience-targeting) to selectively show or hide your teams templates to specific users or groups.
- Use the [SalesTim API](/api/) to automate your Microsoft Teams governance or create your own teams provisioning workflow.
